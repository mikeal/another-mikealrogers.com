## Collected Work

I've been deep in computers and writing code for about 20 years. For more than a decade nearly [all of my work](https://github.com/mikeal) 
has been in Open Source. I've maintained a fairly consistent focus on community, most notably working as part of the 
[io.js fork](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2855057/application-development/why-iojs-decided-to-fork-nodejs.html) of Node.js 
to [define the governance structure](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951) Node.js still uses today.

My focus nowadays is on the ["Decentralized Web."](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/08/decentralisation-next-big-step-for-the-world-wide-web-dweb-data-internet-censorship-brewster-kahle) 
Specifically, a vision of "The Web" in which application data is decentralized using [content addressed data structures.](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/01)
